## Profile

I am a self-motivated and competent software engineer. The mixture of academic and industry work has enabled me to break down problems to design software such that it is extensible and future-proof. It has also provided me with the skills to analyse technologies and languages quickly to see what is suitable for individual tasks.

## Education

### University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom

#### PhD in Computer Science <span class="date pull-right">Sep 2012 &mdash; Dec 2017</span>

My research was primarily looking at how we can derive confidence in black-box processes using previous executions. We used traceability as a mechanism to see what was occurring within these black-boxes at runtime and used it as a basis for learning.

I was the year's representative on the Staff/Research Students Consultative Committee (SRSCC) for my first and third years. Additionally, I was the representative for Teaching Assistants, on the Teaching Committee, for my third year.

#### MSC Computer Security <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2011 &mdash; Sep 2012</span>

During my summer project, I developed a malformed network packet generation framework that allowed me to craft the necessary ARP packets required to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">De Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom</h3>

#### BSc Software Engineering <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2005 &mdash; Aug 2009</span>

I was the first-year representative for the course.

My course included a year’s placement at Language Courses Abroad Ltd (see Experience).

My final year project involved transforming one programming language into another:

  * I had to learn two languages intimately to be able to do the transformation.
  * This is where I got my interest in meta-programming and model-to-model transformation.

## Experience

### Consulting Software Engineer

I am currently a freelance software developer.

#### Progressive Access Ltd <span class="date pull-right">Apr 2016 &mdash; Present</span>

Working with this company to help develop a generic workflow that enables users with visual impairments to read diagrams. This process used a plethora of languages as each component had particular requirements. An important part of this work was to be able to integrate them into a web service.

### University of Birmingham

#### Senior Teaching Assistant <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2005 &mdash; Jun 2016</span>

As a teaching assistant, I further aided in students' development through small group tutorials, marking and demonstrating in labs. As a senior teaching assistant, I would plan tutorials and exercises, and manage other tutors to provide a consistent learning platform.

I was awarded with the TA of the year for my second year of teaching.

#### Demonstrator <span class="date pull-right">Jan 2012 &mdash; Apr 2012</span>

Demonstrating involved facilitating students' learning by helping them help themselves to solve any issues or bugs that arose from development.

### Worldwide Clinical Trials Inc.

<h4>UNIX Software Engineer <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2009 &mdash; Sep 2011</span></h4>

I was a co-business owner on a few of trials, this involved:

  * Liaising with projects managers directly from requirements gathering to the deployment of software.
  * Documenting work required: specification, alpha-tests and linking them to requirements.
  * Risk assessment of work using Good Automated Manufacturing Practice standards (GAMP5).

Additionally, a core member of an R&D team aiming to provide a web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). Researching topics like:

  * Service Orientated Architecture - How we could integrate legacy and third-party systems. 
  * Cloud Computing - How a private cloud would benefit the company.
  * Language Frameworks - PHP (Zend), JavaScript (jQuery), Java (Spring).
  * Security - How to provide these services while protecting sponsors’ data.

### Language Course Abroad Ltd

#### Web Developer <span class="date pull-right">Aug 2007 &mdash; Aug 2008</span>

My placement year for my undergraduate degree at De Montfort University.

My core responsibilities were to:

  * Develop a bespoke booking system for their apartment block.
  * Maintain and develop their web infrastructure for advertising their language courses.
  * Liaise with in-house translators to translate web content for static websites.

All projects required a reasonable level of web security; this is where my interest in the subject began.

### Non-subject specific work experience

I have also previously been a purchase ledger clerk, a barman, and a sales assistant.

These roles gave me the time to interact with customers, clients and suppliers directly to sell or to query information to complete my duties.
