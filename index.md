title: I'm Dr John T. Saxon.
---
# Hi, my name is John Saxon.

I am a self-motivated and competent software engineer. The mixture of academic and industry work has enabled me to break down problems to design software such that it is extensible and future proof. It has also provided me with the skills to analyse technologies and languages quickly to see what is suitable for individual tasks.

## Education

### University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom

#### PhD in Computer Science <span class="date pull-right">Sep 2012 &mdash; Dec 2017</span>

Representative on the Staff/Research Students Consultative Committee (SRSCC) for my first and third years. Representative for Teaching Assistants, on the Teaching Committee, for my third year.

I'll get back to you on this.

#### MSC Computer Security <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2011 &mdash; Sep 2012</span>

My summer project involved a malformed network packet generation framework allowing me to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using crafted ARP packets.

### De Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom

#### BSc Software Engineering <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2005 &mdash; Aug 2009</span>

I was the first-year representative for the course.

My course included a year’s placement at Language Courses Abroad Ltd (see Experience).

My final year project involved transforming one programming language into another:

  * I had to learn two languages intimately to be able to do the transformation.
  * This is where I got my interest in meta-programming and model-to-model transformation.

## Experience

### Consulting Software Engineer

I am currently a freelance software developer.

#### Progressive Access Ltd <span class="date pull-right">Apr 2016 &mdash; Present</span>

With this company I helped develop a generic workflow that enables users with visual impairments to read diagrams.
This used a plethora of languages as each component was originally written as such. A key part of this work was to be able to integrate into a web service.

### University of Birmingham

#### Senior Teaching Assistant <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2005 &mdash; Jun 2016</span>

As teaching assistant, I further aided in students' development through small group tutorials, marking and demonstrating in labs. As a senior teaching assistant, I would plan tutorials and exercises, and manage other tutors to provide a consistent learning platform.

I was awarded with the TA of the year for my second year of teaching.

#### Demonstrator <span class="date pull-right">Jan 2012 &mdash; Apr 2012</span>

Demonstrating involved facilitating students' learning by helping them help themselves to solve any issues or bugs that arose from development.

### Worldwide Clinical Trials Inc.

<h4>UNIX Software Engineer <span class="date pull-right">Oct 2009 &mdash; Sep 2011</span></h4>

I was a co-business owner on a few of trials, this involved:

  * Liaising with projects managers directly from requirements gathering to the deployment of software.
  * Documenting work required: specification, alpha-tests and linking them to requirements.
  * Risk assessment of work using Good Automated Manufacturing Practice standards (GAMP5).

Additionally, a core member of an R&D team aiming to provide a web based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). Researching topics like:

  * Service Orientated Architecture - How we could integrate legacy and third-party systems. 
  * Cloud Computing - How a private cloud would benefit the company.
  * Language Frameworks - PHP (Zend), JavaScript (jQuery), Java (Spring).
  * Security - How to provide these services while protecting sponsors’ data.

### Language Course Abroad Ltd

#### Web Developer <span class="date pull-right">Aug 2007 &mdash; Aug 2008</span>

This was my placement year for my undergraduate degree at De Montfort University.

My core responsibilities were to:

  * Develop a bespoke booking system for their apartment block.
  * Maintain and develop their web infrastructure for advertising their language courses.
  * Liaise with in-house translators to translate web content for static web-sites.

All projects required a good level of web security, this is where my interest in the subject began.

### Non-subject specific work experience

I have also previously been a purchase ledger clerk, a barman, and a sales assistant.

These roles gave me the time to interact with customers, clients and suppliers directly to sell or to query information to complete my duties.
